EVTOPTA_WoL_12021;别傻站着了, 把他放出来!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12022;Your guards inform you that yet another peasant family has been found butchered not far from where the first grisly murders took place. This time the killer was caught in the act, and he was perforated by arrows when he tried to escape your guardsmen. It would seem the peasant you had imprisoned was innocent after all. Unfortunately he perished in your dungeons months ago.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12022;Well, how was I to know?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12501;Your understanding of all matters pertaining to rulership and administration has increased.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12502;Recent events have increased your grasp of stewardship.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12503;Ruling from your court has increased your sense of justice. Your judgments have a profound effect on the lives of your subjects, and you have decided to be more fair.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12504;As more and more people seek audience at your court, you have come to realize that there is much to do when it comes to the administration of the realm. You must work harder!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12505;You are no longer content to rest on your laurels. The problems facing your realm are legion, and clearly no one can fix them but you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12026;The feuding between [feuding_noble_1.GetBestName] and [feuding_noble_2.GetBestName] has reached your court, and can no longer be ignored. As your vassals, both have brought their grievances against each other to you in the hope of garnering your support.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12026;[feuding_noble_1.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly in the right.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_12027;A party of soldiers flying the banner of [farm_fire_noble.GetBestName] recently set up camp in the middle of a field belonging to a farmer in [Root.Capital.GetName]. According to the farmer, their camp fire spread out of control and his entire crop was reduced to ashes. He has brought the matter before your court and demands compensation.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12027;[farm_fire_noble.GetTitledFirstName] is to compensate the farmer.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12027;The fire was a divine act. No one is responsible.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12027;I shall pay the farmer out of my own coffers.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12028;A woman accused of witchcraft in [witch_province.GetName] has been dragged before your court.

EVTDESC_WoL_12029;Several tavern owners in [drunken_rampage.GetName] have come forward to your court with complaints against [noble_drunkard.GetBestName]. Apparently, [noble_drunkard.GetSheHe] has gone on drunken rampages in all of their establishments, and they are demanding compensation. [noble_drunkard.GetTitledFirstName] claims to have no memory of the nights in question.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12029;[noble_drunkard.GetTitledFirstName] shall compensate the tavern owners.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12029;Drinking and debauchery are what your taverns are for, are they not?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12029;Sigh... I will pay.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12031;During a visit to [mayor_city.GetName], [brigands_noble.GetBestName] and [brigands_noble.GetHerHis] entourage were accosted by brigands who made off with several valuables. Efforts to catch the thieves have failed, and [brigands_noble.GetTitledFirstName] is now demanding compensation from [brigands_mayor.GetBestName]. The matter has been brought for arbitration at your court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WoL_12031;It seems fair. [brigands_mayor.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for what was lost.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WoL_12031;[brigands_mayor.GetTitledFirstName] can hardly be held responsible for this theft!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WoL_12031;I will personally compensate [brigands_noble.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12506;Whether it is deserved or not, your decisions at court have earned you a reputation of being incredibly wise. People journey from far away to seek your advice.;;;;;;;;;x

While the cups are being refilled, [From.GetTitledFirstName] brings out a strange board with little decorated pieces, explaning that it's a kind of strategy game.

EVTOPTC_WOL_11006;I will show no mercy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_WOL_11007;You step up to your opponent, [From.GetBestName], in the duel and raise your blade. The fight is intense from the start as both of you strike hard into the others blade. It is unclear who will walk out of this victoriously for a long while until your blade gets parried to the opposite side of your weapon arm which yields [From.GetBestName] an opportunity at your defenseless arm. The pain goes through your whole body as your opponents blade digs deep into your arm and you scream louder than a furious bear but the duel is nonetheless lost.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_WOL_11007;The duel starts violently as your tactic is to strike at [From.GetBestName]'s garde repeatedly until it folds. Your opponent however seems proficient at [From.GetHerHis] skill with the blade and blocks your every attack with relative ease and eventually you grow more and more fatigued from your repeated attacks. That is the time when [From.GetBestName] manages to fool you feinting a high strike while pulling [From.GetHerHis] blade down and landing it in your leg. You wound hinders your movement in the battle and you realize that you have lost and yields to your opponent.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_11007;Curses!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11008;Dueling against [From.GetBestName] was surely supposed to be a great challenge but you step up to it and begin the fight.

Suddenly you find yourself without your sword and on your knees with your opponent the clear victor. But instead of walking away [From.GetBestName] steps up to you. You plead for mercy but [From.GetBestName] just smirks as [From.GetSheHe] raises [From.GetHerHis] sword and strike you down for good.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_WOL_11009;You rush [opponent.GetBestName] with your sword raised as soon as your duel begins. [opponent.GetFirstName] is equally aggressive and delivers hateful blows that you barely manage to block with the edge of your blade. The crowd gasps in suprise of the fury that is displayed in front of their eyes. Both of you occasionally lands a blow against the other that to a normal man would have him down to the ground in pain but the duel continues as both of you refuse to yield. With a fast swing you hit [opponent.GetFirstName] in the side opening up a fatal wound and you seem victorious only to find [opponent.GetFirstName]'s blade stuck in your stomach.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_WOL_11011;As you enter the circle that the crowd has created you already know that you will be victorious against your weak opponent, [opponent.GetBestName]. Your opponent enters the ring in a fashion opposed to your confident entry, as he charges headlong towards you swinging mindlessly at your garde.

EVTDESC_WOL_11012;The fight against [From.GetBestName] was going to be a one-sided fight so you thought that you needed to catch him by suprise. Therefore you thought it was a good idea to charge him right as he stood there mockingly in taking the crowd's praising cheering. However your sudden move didn't catch your opponent off guard as he effortlessly parries and dodges your swings. After you clearly miss with an overhead swing [From.GetBestName] has all the time in the world to carefully swing at your exposed neck and your head makes a small loop as it descends to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_11101;Let's go running.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WOL_11102;It grinds my gears but I might upset people if I lecture people just like that.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11103;A small spear-throwing contest could be fun aswell as helping you train for battle. Maybe you should arrange such a contest at your court?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_11103;My throwing arm will amaze everyone!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WOL_11103;Maybe another time.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11104;Everyone in the spear-throwing contest is having a great time, throwing spears, discussing and laughing. Basically enjoying themselves. Maybe enjoying themselves a bit too much as a spear is thrown carelessly while someone is out on the field measuring the distance from a previous spear.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_11104;Well that's unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_11107;After dozens of spears have flown through the sky one sole victor emerges from the competition. No-one threw farther than you!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_11110;Your daily routine involves swinging blades at a training dummy. But you can only learn so much from fighting an inanimate enemy and it gets kind of dull after a while.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_11112;Even with blunt blades a training fight is a dangerous thing. Sometimes a sword might strike just a bit too hard.;;;;;;;;;x
